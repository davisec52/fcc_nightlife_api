<h4>Requirements for Project Completiion @ https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://yasser-nightlife-app.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.</li>

	<li>Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.</li>

	<li>User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.</li>

	<li>User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.</li>

	<li>User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.</li>

	<li>User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.</li>
	
	<li>Hint: Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.</li>
